# DAD is not intended to be used as a social media platform,
# and many users may want to be able to post here freely without worrying
# that non-4chan users will find out about their DAD account.

# For this reason, we block all search engine bots across the entire site,
# so that DAD accounts and posts will not occur in search results,
# and so that DAD submissions will not appear in reverse image search.

# The administrator of the site currently *also* blocks bots using Cloudflare,
# but the web scrapers for all major services respect `robots.txt`,
# so this is the more open and perhaps reliable way to accomplish that.

# Disallow all bots.
