  # Choose what kind of storage to use for this uploader:

  # Provide a default URL as a default if there hasn't been a file uploaded:

  # process scale: [200, 300]

  version :thumb do

  # Add a white list of extensions which are allowed to be uploaded.
  # For images you might use something like this:

  # Avoid using model.id or version_name here, see uploader/store.rb for details.
